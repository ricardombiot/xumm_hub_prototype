<p align="center"> xApp Freelancer is a learning side project of XRP Ledger technology. The idea was to test if we were capable (in less than 2 weeks) of being able to build a working prototype of a platform for freelancers and companies using Ripple's technology.

## üí° Business opportunity <a name = "idea"></a>

The business idea behind the project is to create a freelancer portal that uses the XRP Ledger escrow technology to ensure safe custody of payments. By taking advantage of this technology, the platform eliminates the need to directly maintain and guard users' money, which in turn allows avoiding abusive commissions for management (up 20%) and currency exchanges.

On the other hand, if you have ever worked on these current platforms, you will know that their terms often limit communication between companies and freelancers to only the platform, and border on illegal, even allowing the license to read the messages that companies make. and businesses on their platform, looking for them not to do business through other means than the platform itself, all due to the fact that they seek those abusive commissions... not to mention that they retain the money for periods of 30 days or more , as well as making changes between currencies totally out of the market... all at plataform complete discretion, without any justification... with blockchain technology all this will change for the better for companies and freelancers.

It would not be strange to think that, in the future, when the adoption of blockchain technology is more widespread, these freelance platforms will have to change their business models and open the doors to the new world of business and international transfers, which will speak a common language: Speed, Efficiency and Freedom.

That is why our project seeks, in a few weeks, to try to learn how technologies such as XRP Ledger will allow us to build freelance platforms in the future, where:

- Commissions are zero (or very low).
- The rules are set by companies and freelancers, not by platforms.
- Freelancers get paid on time efficiently, and without waiting. 
- ‚Ä¶

In summary: 

> Your work, your rules, your earnings: No commissions on your success path!


## üßê Challenges and Opportunities <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

The challenges at the business level lead us towards the technical challenges that we will address later in this huge spike.

### Busines Chanllenges

- Guarantee Payments and Compliance:
  Ensuring that both freelancers and clients are protected in terms of payments is essential. Implementing an escrow system (such as the use of escrows in the XRP Ledger) can resolve this concern, but it must be carefully managed so that both parties are satisfied. Clear rules must be defined on when and how payments are released to avoid misunderstandings.

- Dispute resolution:
  Disputes are inevitable on any freelance platform. Having a transparent and efficient process to resolve disputes is critical to maintaining trust in the platform. Implementing an impartial mediation or arbitration system can help resolve issues fairly and prevent disputes from escalating to harmful levels. In the future, thanks to smart contracts, we could address this point to minimize the risks associated with hiring a freelancer as well as working for a company that is not very responsible with payments.

- Trust and Security: Trust and security are  crucial to attract both freelancers and clients. Transparently showing how payments and personal information are handled, as well as using strong cybersecurity measures, can build trust among users. Education about security practices and constant communication about privacy policies are also important to building lasting relationships.

  At this point, we do not have to invent the wheel, we can integrate with Xumm so that this is the platform that manages the signatures of the escrows and transfers, allowing us to delegate all those extensive security responsibilities associated with Xumm. This also allows us to give users confidence that our system will not work at any time with the keys of our users' wallets.

- Intense Competition: The freelance platforms market are highly competitive, which means that any new platform must stand out to attract freelancers and clients. This implies that a large part of the costs would be allocated to marketing.

  However, there are an opportunity to reduce these costs, if this application was integrated into the Xumm application marketplace and therefore was at the heart of the XRP ecosystem, marketing costs would be very low since our platform is free of charge. It would be accessible to all current and future users of the XRP ecosystem. We are talking about a global service for all XRP Ledger users.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- What are the dependencies of your project?
- Describe each limitation in detailed but concise terms
- Explain why each limitation exists
- Provide the reasons why each limitation could not be overcome using the method(s) chosen to acquire.
- Assess the impact of each limitation in relation to the overall findings and conclusions of your project, and if
  appropriate, describe how these limitations could point to the need for further research.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

Write about what you could not develop during the course of the Hackathon; and about what your project can achieve
in the future.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development
and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```
